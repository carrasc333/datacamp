## Writing your own functions

In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

### Write a simple function

```
# Define the function shout
def shout():
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = 'congratulations' + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout
shout()

```

### Single-parameter functions

```
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout with the string 'congratulations'
shout('congratulations')

```

### Functions that return single values

```
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Return a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Replace print with return
    return shout_word

# Pass 'congratulations' to shout: yell
yell = shout('congratulations')

# Print yell
print(yell)

```
